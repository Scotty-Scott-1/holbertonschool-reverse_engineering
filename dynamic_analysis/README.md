What are the key differences between static and dynamic analysis, and why is dynamic analysis important in reverse engineering?

What techniques can be employed in dynamic analysis, such as setting breakpoints, performing memory dumping, and tracing program execution?

How can debugging tools like GDB, x64dbg, and OllyDbg be effectively utilized to analyze binary files and track their execution?

What methods can be used to monitor system behavior during program execution, particularly using tools like Process Monitor and Wireshark?

How does a program interact with the operating system, including its file system access, API calls, and network communications?

What best practices should be followed for documenting findings from dynamic analysis, including observed behaviors and potential vulnerabilities?

In what real-world scenarios can dynamic analysis skills be applied, such as in malware analysis, security testing, and software debugging?
